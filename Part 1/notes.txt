Hey there, here are the notes. Enjoy! :)

WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, high-level and object-oriented programming language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITIONS:

High-level: Complex stuff is automatically taken care of by JavaScript, for example: memory management.

Multi-paradigm: We can code with JavaScript using many different programming styles.

Object-oriented: JavaScript mainly uses objects (more on objects later on in the crash course) to store data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments are notes for other programmers or for yourself if you want to know what a line of code does.

Multi lines comment syntax: /* comment */

Single line comment syntax: // comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to recap from the video:

The alert function displays a pop-up window that can be dismissed.

The syntax for alert is: alert("string");
